# Object_Detection
Object detection using YOLO (You Only Look Once) v3 is a popular and efficient deep learning model that can detect multiple objects in an image or video in real time. YOLO v3 is known for its speed and accuracy, as it processes an entire image at once, rather than scanning the image in patches like traditional object detection methods. The model uses a single convolutional neural network (CNN) to predict the bounding boxes and class probabilities for each object within the image. YOLO v3 improves upon its predecessors by incorporating multiple layers of feature extraction and utilizing anchor boxes, allowing it to detect objects at different scales. It is widely used in applications such as autonomous driving, security systems, and real-time video analysis.

Step 1: Download YOLOv3 Pre-trained Weights and Configuration File
  1. YOLOv3 Weights:

Visit the official YOLO website or the YOLOv3 GitHub repository to download the pre-trained weights.
YOLOv3 Weights (from the official YOLO site)
Alternatively, you can download them directly from the YOLOv3 GitHub releases page.
The file you'll be downloading is named yolov3.weights (around 236 MB).
  2. YOLOv3 Configuration File:

Download the yolov3.cfg file from the official YOLO repository:
    
  3. YOLOv3.cfg on GitHub
    
You can simply right-click and "Save As" to save the .cfg file.

Step 2: Download COCO Names File (for class labels)
You will also need a coco.names file, which contains the labels for the 80 classes YOLOv3 can detect. Download it from:
coco.names. its already present in the code but if you want you you can download it.

Step 3: Set Up YOLOv3
Once you have the yolov3.weights, yolov3.cfg, and coco.names files, you can start using YOLOv3 in your project. To do this, you typically need:
OpenCV or Darknet (a framework for YOLO) to load these files and run detection.
You can use pre-built scripts or frameworks like OpenCV's DNN module or the Darknet repository itself.
Example Directory Structure:
Your project directory should look like this:

    /your_project/
  yolov3.cfg
  yolov3.weights
  coco.names
  your_script.py
